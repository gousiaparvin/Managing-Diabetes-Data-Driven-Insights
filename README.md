# Overview
This project leverages interactive visualizations to analyze and understand the impact of Type 2 Diabetes across the United States. By examining hospital visits, healthcare spending, and complications, this dashboard provides actionable insights for healthcare providers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. The goal is to use data-driven approaches to improve patient care, optimize resource allocation, and address critical healthcare challenges.

# Key Features of the Dashboard
Hospital Visits: Analyzing how frequently patients visit hospitals and which complications contribute most to these visits.
Healthcare Spending: Visualizing the financial burden of managing Type 2 Diabetes across states.
Complications: Identifying the most common complications (e.g., neuropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular issues) and their regional distribution.
Regional Trends: Highlighting trends across states to identify high-impact areas requiring interventions.

# Goals
For Doctors: Provide insights to improve patient care and target effective treatments.
For Hospitals: Assist in resource allocation by identifying high-need areas and trends.
For Policymakers: Enable better planning of interventions in regions with the highest diabetes impact.


# This dashboard was built using Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio), an interactive tool for creating dynamic visualizations. Hereâ€™s how it was utilized:
# 1. Geo Maps
Displayed the distribution of hospital visits and healthcare spending by state.
Highlighted high-cost regions and states with the most patients, making it easy to identify geographic hotspots.
# 2. Bar Charts
Compared hospital visits and complications across states.
Enabled clear visualization of which states experience the most healthcare challenges due to diabetes.
# 3. Time Series Charts
Tracked monthly trends for:
Hospital Visits: To identify seasonal or temporal changes.
HbA1c Levels: To monitor the effectiveness of diabetes management.
Provided insights on whether diabetes control efforts are improving over time.
# 4. Tables
Created sortable tables to allow detailed comparisons of:
Total patients by state.
Average healthcare spending per patient.
Most common complications in each state.
Enabled granular analysis for stakeholders.
# 5. Filters
Added dropdown filters to allow users to explore the data interactively by:
Gender: Male or Female.
Complications: Neuropathy, Retinopathy, Cardiovascular issues, etc.
Medications: Metformin, Insulin, SGLT2 inhibitors, etc.
# 6. Scorecards (KPIs)
Displayed key performance indicators at the top of the dashboard:
Total number of patients.
Average healthcare spending per patient.
Success rate of interventions.


# Interactive and Dynamic: Users can drill down into specific states, trends, and filters for personalized insights.
Visually Engaging: Complex data is represented through maps, charts, and tables, making it accessible to various audiences.
Actionable Insights: Helps healthcare professionals and policymakers make informed decisions to manage Type 2 Diabetes effectively.

# The dashboard provides real-time insights and can be accessed interactively to explore the following:
Regional comparisons of hospital visits and complications.
Trends in HbA1c levels and hospital visits over time.
Cost distributions across various states and treatment modalities.

# Future Enhancements
Predictions: Add machine learning models to forecast patient counts and healthcare spending trends.
Regional Aggregation: Group states into broader regions (e.g., West, Midwest) for high-level insights.
Real-Time Data: Integrate live data sources to provide up-to-date trends.
Advanced Filters: Enable multi-dimensional filtering for deeper exploration.
